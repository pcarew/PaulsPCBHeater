To Return Arduino Target to normal Arduino program loading, after being used with DWire, the fuses need to be reset.
Using the DebugWire intermediate system (operates as a stk500 v1 programmer), issue the following command line:
avrdude  -c stk500v1 -p m328p -PCOM3 -b 19200 -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m

These next two commands read the status of the target Arduino:
avrdude -c stk500v1 -p m328p -P COM3 -b 19200 -v
avrdude  -c stk500v1 -p m328p -PCOM3 -U hfuse:r:-:h
