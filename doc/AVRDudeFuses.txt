To Return Arduino Target to normal Arduino program loading, after being used with DWire ( https://github.com/felias-fogg/dw-link/blob/master/docs/manual.md ), the fuses need to be reset.
Using the DebugWire programmer Arduino (operates as a stk500 v1 programmer), issue the following command line:

avrdude  -c stk500v1 -p m328p -PCOM3 -b 19200 -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m

These next two commands read the status of the target Arduino:
avrdude -c stk500v1 -p m328p -P COM3 -b 19200 -v
avrdude  -c stk500v1 -p m328p -PCOM3 -U hfuse:r:-:h


After resetting the fuses, the Arduino Bootloader must be re-installed in the target.

Use the Boatloader programmer cable to cable between Programmer abd target boards
