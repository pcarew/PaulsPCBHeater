To Return Arduino Target to normal Arduino program loading, after being used with DWire ( https://github.com/felias-fogg/dw-link/blob/master/docs/manual.md ), the fuses need to be reset.
Using the DebugWire programmer Arduino (operates as a stk500 v1 programmer), issue the following command line:

avrdude  -c stk500v1 -p m328p -PCOM3 -b 19200 -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m

These next two commands read the status of the target Arduino:
avrdude -c stk500v1 -p m328p -P COM3 -b 19200 -v
avrdude  -c stk500v1 -p m328p -PCOM3 -U hfuse:r:-:h


After resetting the fuses, the Arduino Bootloader must be re-installed in the target.
Follow this guide: https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4841602539164-Burn-the-bootloader-on-UNO-Mega-and-classic-Nano-using-another-Arduino
Use the Bootloader programmer cable to cable between Programmer abd target boards

**If Using DWLink as programmer, skip 'A' and select 'AVR ISP' as programmer in Section 'C' ***

A) 1st setup programmer board (Can be skipped if using DWLink)
Connect the programmer board to the computer.
Select your programmer board in Tools > Board, for example Tools > Board > Arduino AVR Boards > Arduino Uno.
Select the port the board is connecting to in Tools > Port.
Open File > Examples > 11.ArduinoISP > ArduinoISP
Upload 'ArduinoISP Programmer' sketch

B) Connect Boatloader cable

C) Burn bootloader via programmer
Select the target board in Tools > Board (target is UNO).
Select Tools > Programmer > Arduino as ISP (*** unless using DWLink as programmer, in which case use AVR ISP ***)
Select Tools > Burn Bootloader

D) Test
Return Arduino programmer setting to 'AVR ISP'
Connect USB to target
upload 'Blink' or some other Arduino sketch as verification
Note: If target still has reset track cut - a manual reset button activation will be needed
